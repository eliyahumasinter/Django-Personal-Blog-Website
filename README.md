# Django-Personal-Blog-Website
Personal website built using the Django framework

# IsraelBlog
This personal blog was built using Python and Django

This website was originally built in Flask, the code can be seen at my Flask-Personal-Blog-Website repository. However, that website was not very nice and I wanted something more scaleable. Django was the perfect option. I converted the Flask-Personal-Blog-Website to Django, significantly improved the front end for both mobile and non-mobile users, and drastically improved the performance of the website by changing a key few features outlined below.

# Technologies Employed
The backend was built using Python and the Django module The front end obviously used HTML and quite a bit of personalized CSS, but it also used quite a few Bootstrap elements. The database was developed using SQLite3, but I might switch that to MySQL once it is deployed.

# Key changes
Each post is now its own page so that the server doesn't have to send all of the posts for the home page as the old website had it do. The images are now displayed using bootstrap's carousel feature which improves the users' experience. From the admin's side the new admin page is a game-changer. I can now easily add and update posts thanks to Djangos auto-generated admin page.
